1) div.cc - Extend object prototype of HTMLElement and add function to create and append child simultaneously?
1a) div.<attr> - Extend object prototype of HTMLElement to change height, width, etc. attributes through HTMLElement.setAttribute
Consider functional and otherwise obvious issues with extending a native object prototype. Alternatives? Probably just as well to use jQuery but less is more.

2) Allow every id in the makeIC function to update model/view

4) Expand inputC() function to accept ic object referencing dynamically created els

3) Expand the post() function to append element to chosen destination node

5) Create css() function which takes a styles object and applies styles to dynamically created HTML Elements

6) Expand mdl card function to produce complete card component or all card subcomponents

7) Complete documentation for doc object
